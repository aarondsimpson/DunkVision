<h1>üèÄ Dunk Vision</h1>

Dunk Vision is a basketball shot tracker and spatial data capture tool built using Python (3.12.10) and tkinter. Designed for youth coaches, players, and parents, it lets users track, visualize, export, and analyze shot data to improve individual and team performance on-court and in-training. 

<h2>‚ùì Rationale </h2>

Youth organizations are propped up by limited funding, over-stretched coaches, burned-out parents, and the goodwill of local communities. Jerseys often escape the budget. Lunch is provided by turn-taking parents. Training is last-minute as coaches and teenagers balance their personal lives.  

Supporting my stepson through middle school basketball, high school basketball, summer camps, youth leagues, and local competitions, it became clear that he and his teammates were going to struggle to receive the support that they needed, paid to receive, and deserved, to move them forward in their sports careers. 

For this reason, I built a tool that turns wild pickup games into strategic opportunities, last-minute training sessions into focused workshops, and bus-rides home into structured pre-game and post-game briefs where hazy memory, hunches, and napkin scribbles are thrown out in favor of robust, real-time data analysis. I built a tool that helps busy coaches react to the patterns and trends they missed while juggling parent politics, a tool that helps parents understand their children's role on the court with accessible metrics, and a tool that helps players focus on developing within their lane. I wanted a tool that would turn a team winning 1 out of every 5 games into a team that stood a chance of winning every time they step onto the court.

<h2>üìã Usage</h2>

1. Launch the application
2. Select "New" or "Load" from the start screen
    - If "New ", edit the default "My Team" and "Their Team" teams by renaming the teams and adding, removing, or renaming players.
    - If "Load", re-select the persistently saved teams to the "My Team" and "Their Team" slot to continue tracking shots. 
3. Select the game quarter to ensure shots are tracked in the correct quarter, then select the player to be tracked from the team roster.
4. Click on the court to record a shot, completing the modal sequence to gather shot data and update the scoreboard. 
5. Review the real-time data analysis card on the right of the screen as shots are recorded throughout the game. 
6. Select "Save Game" to create a "dv-game.json" file that can be loaded later for review or further tracking. 
7. Select "Export Image" to create a ".png" of the court showing the shot locations. 
8. Export game data for further analysis by selecting "Export CSV" or "Export JSON".

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Once new teams are added, you must first have "My Team" selected, then select the new team from the dropdown to swap it with "My Team" to have that custom team appear as *your team*. Equally, when adding a team for "Their Team", you must select "Their Team" first, then the dropdown, then select the new team to swap it and record it as the opponent team.  



<h2>üí° Use Cases</h2>

- üëâ **Coaches**
    - Spot team-wide trends for shot locations, distances, and zones to build a picture of how the team uses court space
    - Review player shot maps to create custom drills and assign individualized performance goals
    - Monitor opposing team strengths and weaknesses and create solid defensive strategies on a team-by-team basis
    - Counter individual threats by using player data to create better matchup plans

- üëâ **Parents**
    - Support your children by capturing and recording their in-game data to provide visual and textual evidence of performance
    - Fill the gaps left by youth leagues by providing your children with the coaching advice they need from real performances

- üëâ **Players**
    - Use after-hours training and solo session time more intelligently by identifying and improving personalized weaknesses
    - Do you think you're better than your teammate, or your friends? Prove it with a shotmap and intuitive stats. If you really dunk more, then prove it.
