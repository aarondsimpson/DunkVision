<h1>Dunk Vision</h1>

Dunk Vision is a desktop basketball shot tracker and data capture tool built using Python and tkinter. Designed for youth coaches, players, and parents, it lets users track, visualize, and analyze shot data to improve individual and team performance as well as direct training efforts. For courtside users, data can be exported for later analysis.

<h2> Rationale </h2>

Supporting my stepson through middle school basketball, summer camps, youth leagues, and high school basketball it became clear that youth organizations for basketball are propped up by limited funding, parent support, over-stretched coaches, and the goodwill of local communities.

Jerseys often escape the budget. Lunch is often brought by generous turn-taking parents. Training is often last-minute and inconsistent as coaches balance their personal lives.

Despite the enthusiasm to participate in this community, I was met with frustration to see my stepson receiving less support than was paid to receive. For this reason, I wanted to build a tool that would turn wild pickup games into structured, targeted training sessions based on the strengths and weaknesses of their previous performances beyond memory or guesswork. I wanted a tool that would support busy coaches to react to the patterns and trends that were missed while juggling parent politics. I wanted a tool that would turn our team that was winning 1 out of every 5 games into a team that stood a chance of winning every time they stepped on the court.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>ü§æ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Player Management</h3>

1. Default player profiles based on basketball positions, such as 'Small Forward' and 'Point Guard'
2. Custom player profiles based on user definition to change 'Small Forward' to 'John Smith'
3. Switching between player profiles during sessions to track multiple players across both teams

<h3>üèÄ Game Management</h3>

1. Users can select the quarter in which they are recording shots
2. Users can mark the game as finished to end the data collection process
3. Court will be zoned into 2pt and 3pt areas
4. Court will be zoned into strategic zones, such as 'Left Slot' or 'Top of Key'

<h3>üíæ Saving and Loading</h3>

1. Users can navigate away from the app without losing session data
2. Users can close the app and return to it and restore temporary data
3. Users are wanred with a 'Unsaved Data' modal when attempting to exit the application
4. Users can save partial game sessions to the local memory
5. Users can load sessions from the local memory
6. Users can save player profiles peristently for tracking across multiple sessions and multiple games

<h3>‚ö°Court Interaction</h3>

1. User selects an area of the court and is met with a color circle gradient to visually confirm touch
2. User will receive pop-up box asking if the shot was 'Made', 'Miss', or 'Dunk'
    - For 'Made':
        - If shot was located within the 2pt area, the user selects 'And-1', 'From Rebound', or 'Layup'
        - If shot was located within the 3pt area, the user selects SHOT TYPE? 'Catch and Shoot' or 'Off the Dribble' and then is met with SHOT PRESSURE? 'Contested', 'Wide Open', 'End of Shot Clock'
    - For 'Missed':
        - User will be met with 'Airball', 'Rebound', and 'Turnover' as selectable options
3. After 'Made' sequence, the court is painted with a green dot
4. After 'Missed' sequence, the court is painted with a red dot
5. After 'Dunk' sequence, the court is painted with a gold dot

<h3> üéØAdditional Planned Features</h3>

- Color-coding or icons to represent different players on the heatmap, rather than uniform coloring that can be interpreted in the raw file
- Undo button that removes previous entries - dots on the map will not have selection boxes because adding new shots in similar places will be messy
- On selecting 'Game Finished', a pop-up summary of stats will appear presenting user friendly information for each player, selectable through a drop-down menu
- The pop-up summary will feature a 'compare' to assess the stats of two same-team players, where relevant
- Multi-Team Support: Users can load in default player profiles for an opposing team and track opponents shots
- Multi-Team Pop-Up: Users can compare home team summary stats with away team summary stats
- Multi-Team Pop-Up: Users can compare home team player with opposing team player
- On-Screen Score: Tracking home and opposing team scores as shots are tracked
- Switch between half-court view and full-court view at load
- Light mode v dark mode with different court designs for courtside use
- Load files from third-party cloud storage, like OneDrive.
- Add load screen for aesthetics and to address factors like player profiles and light or dark mode before entering

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

1. Coaches
- Identify team trends by analyzing shot location trends to target team-wide strengths and weaknesses to support training
- Identify player trends by analyzing player shot maps so that bespoke drills and performance goals can be designed
- Assess opposing teams by preparing solid defensive strategies on an opponent-by-opponent basis by understanding shot behavior
- Counter individual threats by understanding the patterns of key opposing players for better matchup planning

2. Parents
- College-recruitment support: parents support their players by capturing data during games to provide visual evidence of shot accuracy
- Compensate youth league gaps: support under-resourced and over-stretched youth leagues with game-changing capabilities

3. Players
- Train smarter: Support after-hours training and solo sessions by identifying and improving weak game areas
- Bragging rights: do you think you're better than your teammate, or your friends? Prove it with a shotmap and intuitive stats
