# DunkVision
Dunk Vision is a desktop basketball shot tracker and data capture tool built using Python and tkinter. Designed for youth coaches, players, and parents, it lets users track, visualize, and analyze shot data to improve individual and team performance as well as direct training efforts. For courtside users, data can be exported for later analysis.
